# slideshareScraper
A selenium based tool that scrapes the Presentations from slideshare and generates the corresponding pdf 

Currently, to convert the images to pdf, open it in Impress or Power Point and import all images from the folder 'images' there and export as PDF or print the presentation.
 
The project was a good investment of 3 hours.
